      <dt>The jeogori</dt>
      <dd> is the basic upper garment of the hanbok, worn by both men and women. It covers the arms and upper part of the wearer's body.
       The basic form of a jeogori consists of gil, git, dongjeong, goreum and sleeves. Gil (Hangul: 길) is the large section of the garment on both front and back sides, and git (Hangul: 깃) is a band of fabric that trims the collar.
       Dongjeong (Hangul: 동정) is a removable white collar placed over the end of the git and is generally squared off. The goreum (Hangul: 고름) are fabric-strings that tie the jeogori.<br>
       Women's jeogori may have kkeutdong (Hangul: 끝동), a different colored cuff placed at the end of the sleeves. </dd><br>
      <dt>The Goreum</dt> 
      <dd>Goreum refers to strings of cloth that fasten clothes together. Fabric goreum were potentially used since Gojoseon. They were originally practical but often decorative. Silla had regulations against types of Dae (belts) and decorative goreum for each Golpoom.
       Southern parts of Korea, including Silla, had a colorful goreum on the front of the neck, which influenced Yayoi culture. 
       Parts of Goguryeo style had a fabric goreum loop around the waist with a decorative ribbon to the side like a belt.<br>
       Generally, thin and short ones were used on the inside and more decorative, colourful ones were used on the outside.</dd><br>
      <dt>The Danchu</dt>
      <dd>Other than fabric strings, danchu (buttons) were also used. There are many types of danchu. One example is the Maedeup-danchu which were often used to keep symmetrical collars together in the front and used for practical uses on military uniforms and court uniforms. 
       They have long horizontal lines on either side like Manchurian buttons or looked like a ball and lasso.<br>
       Magoja-danchu are often big decorative metal, gems or stones buttons usually on Jokki (vest).</dd><br>
      <dt>The Chima</dt>
      <dd>Chima refers to "skirt," and is also called sang (裳) or gun (裙) in hanja. The underskirt, or petticoat layer, is called sokchima. Chima-malgi is the waistband that trims the top of the chima. From Goguryeo[17] to Joseon period, various styles of chima existed such as striped, pleated, patchworked, and gored skirts.
       Chima were typically made from rectangular panels that were pleated or gathered into the chima-malgi (waistband).<br>
       This waistband also had goreum strings for fastening the skirt around the body</dd><br>
      <dt>The Baji</dt>
      <dd>Baji refers to the bottom part of the men's hanbok. It is the formal term for "trousers" in Korean. Compared to western style pants, baji does not fit tightly.
       The roomy design is aimed at making the clothing ideal for sitting on the floor and an ethnic style that dates back to the Three kingdoms period.
       It functions as modern trousers do and the term baji is commonly used in Korea to refer to every kind of pants.
       The baji-malgi is a waistband of the baji that has a long string of goreum.
       Baji can be unlined trousers, leather trousers, silk pants, or cotton pants, depending on style of dress, sewing method, embroidery and so on. </dd><br>
      <dt>The Po</dt>
      <dd>Po is a generic term referring to an outer robe or overcoat. There are two general types of po, the Korean type and the Chinese type.
      The Korean type is a common style from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, and it is used in the modern day.
      There were many ways to fasten the coat but mainly a belt was used in conjunction with a ribbon goreum until the ribbon goreum became mainstream during late Joseon dynasty. Durumagi is a type of po that was worn for protection against the cold. It has been widely worn as an outer robe over jeogori and baji. 
      It is also called jumagui, juchaui, or juui.
      The Chinese type consist of different types of po from mainland China. Starting from the North–South states period, they were mainly adopted as court uniforms that localized into Korean culture throughout history. In 1895, there was a nation-wide adoption of the Korean type durumagi to regulate clothes and luxury items</dd>
    <p>The Childrens Hanbok--Traditionally, Kkachi durumagi (literally "a magpie's overcoat") were worn as seolbim (Hangul: 설빔), new clothing and shoes worn on Korean New Year, while at present, it is worn as a ceremonial garment for dol, the celebration for a baby's first birthday. It is a children's colorful overcoat.
       It was worn mostly by young boys. The clothes is also called obangjang durumagi which means "an overcoat of five directions". It was worn over jeogori (a jacket) and jokki (a vest), while the wearer could put jeonbok (a long vest) over it.
       Kkachi durumagi was also worn along with headgear such as bokgeon (a peaked cloth hat), hogeon (peaked cloth hat with a tiger pattern) for young boys or gulle (decorative headgear) for young girls.</p>

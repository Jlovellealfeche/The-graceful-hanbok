        <p>The first recorded evidence of the name hanbok is from an 1881 document Jeongchiilgi《정치일기》. In the document, 
          hanbok was used to distinguish Korean clothing from Japanese traditional clothing and Western clothing.<br>
          Hanbok was used in an 1895 document describing the assassination of Empress Myeongseong to distinguish Korean clothing from Japanese clothing. <br>
          The origin of the name remains unclear, because these documents predate the Korean Empire (Korean: 대한제국) which popularized the hanja character Han (Hanja: 韓).</p>
        <p>Beginning in 1900, Korean newspapers used the hanja character Han (Hanja: 韓) in words that describe Korean clothing, such as hanguguibok (Korean: 한국의복), hangugyebok (Korean: 한국예복) and daehannyeobok (Korean: 대한녀복). 
          Hanbok was used in a 1905 newspaper article, which described the righteous army wearing Korean clothing.
          After the March 1st Movement, hanbok became a significant ethnic symbol of Koreans.
          Influenced by rising nationalism in the 1900s, hanbok became a word that meant the unique Korean clothing that can be distinguished from that of foreigners, such as Japanese, Western, and Chinese clothing. <br>
          Other words with the same meaning, uriot (Korean: 우리옷) and joseonot (Korean: 조선옷), were concurrently used. Joseonot, which was more popular in the north, replaced the other words in North Korea after the division of Korea.</p>

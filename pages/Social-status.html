      <p>Especially from the Goryeo Dynasty, the hanbok started to determine differences in social status through the many types and components, and their characteristics - from people with the highest social status (kings), to those of the lowest social status (slaves).
        Although the modern Hanbok does not express a person's status or social position,
        Hanbok was an important element of distinguishment especially in the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties.</p>

      <h3>Clothes</h3>

      <h4>Hwarot</h4>
      <p>Hwarot or hwal-ot (Korean: 활옷) was the full dress for a princess and the daughter of a king by a concubine, formal dress for the upper class, and bridal wear for ordinary women during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties.
        Popular embroidered patterns on hwarot were lotuses, phoenixes, butterflies, and the ten traditional symbols of longevity: the sun; mountains; water; clouds; rocks/stone; pine trees; the mushroom of immortality; turtles; white cranes, and deer.
        Each pattern represented a different role within society, for example: a dragon represented an emperor while a phoenix represented a queen; floral patterns represented a princess and a king's daughter by a concubine, and clouds and cranes represented high ranking court officials.
        All these patterns throughout Korean history had meanings of longevity, good luck, wealth and honor. Hwarot also had blue, red, and yellow colored stripes in each sleeve; a woman usually wore a scarlet-colored skirt and yellow or green-colored Jeogori, a traditional Korean jacket.
        Hwarot was worn over the Jeogori and skirt. A woman also wore her hair in a bun, with an ornamental hairpin and a ceremonial coronet. A long ribbon was attached to the ornamental hairpin, the hairpin is known as Yongjam (Korean: 용잠).
        In more recent times, people wear hwarot on their wedding day, and so the Korean tradition survives in the present day.</p>
      
      <h4>Wonsam</h4>
      <p>Wonsam (Korean: 원삼) was a ceremonial overcoat for a married woman in the Joseon dynasty. The Wonsam was also adopted from China and is believed to have been one of the costumes from the Tang dynasty which was bestowed in the Unified Three Kingdoms period.
        It was mostly worn by royalty, high-ranking court ladies, and noblewomen and the colors and patterns represented the various elements of the Korean class system.
        The empress wore yellow; the queen wore red; the crown princess wore a purple-red color; meanwhile a princess, a king's daughter by a concubine, and a woman of a noble family or lower wore green.
        All the upper social ranks usually had two colored stripes in each sleeve: yellow-colored Wonsam usually had red and blue colored stripes, red-colored Wonsam had blue and yellow stripes, and green-colored Wonsam had red and yellow stripes.
        Lower-class women wore many accompanying colored stripes and ribbons, but all women usually completed their outfit with Onhye or Danghye, traditional Korean shoes</p>

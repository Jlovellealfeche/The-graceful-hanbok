        <p>The <strong>hanbok</strong> also called <b>Choson-ot</b> in North Korea and China, is an umbrella
        term which is used to refer to traditional ethnic Korean clothes, including the traditional colthing of 
        the <i>chaoxianzu</i>(korean chinese), an officially recognized ethnic minority in China.</p>
        <p>The term <i>"hanbok"</i> literally means "Korean clothing"</p> 
        <p>Due to the isolation from each other for about 50years, the styles of <i>hanbok</i> in South Korean, North Korea,
        China, worn by Korean ethnics from these 3 countries have developed separately from each other.</p>
        <p>Since the 1990s, the South Korean-style and North Korean-style have been looking more and more similar to each other.</p>
        <p>The ancient <i>hanbok</i> consisted of a <i>jeogori</i> (top), <i>baji</i> (pants), <i>chima</i> (skirt), <i>po</i> (coat). <br>
        The basic structure of <i>hanbok</i> was designed to facilitate the ease of movement and integrated many motifs of Mu-ism.
        These basic structural features of the <i>hanbok</i> remains relatively unchanged to this day.</p>
        <p>However, present-day <i>hanbok</i>, which is worn nowadays, is patterened after the <i>hanbok</i> worn in the Joseon Dynasty
        especially those worn by the nobility and royalty.</p>
